# Programmer-Search
A simple and customizable search tool made with Python, PySide6, and duckduckgo_search

# How to run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CharlieStrachan/Project-Organizer.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Project-Organizer
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:

If you are on linux, you might need to use `python3` instead of `python`.

# How to use
1. Tweak the settings.jsonc and sites.jsonc files to your liking. Adding the sites you want to prioritize and the amount of results you want to see (keep in mind that the more results you want, the longer it will take to search and the easier you will hit the rate limit).

2. Search for anything you want in the search bar at the top of the window. Then click on any of the results to open them in your default web browser.
